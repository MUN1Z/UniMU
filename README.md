# UniMU

Unity3D MU Online Client v1.04d for [OpenMU server](https://github.com/MUnique/OpenMU)

## Goal

Development for fun

## TODO

- esteblish CS connection with OpenMU - DONE
- esteblish GS connection with OpenMU - DONE
- parse map data from original client (height map, terrain etc.)

## Platforms

It should work with PCs.

Maybe on Mobiles.

And it doesn't work for WebGL, because currently OpenMU doesn't support WebSockets.
